Configuring Android Apps
As shown earlier in the course (when adding native modules to non-Expo apps), you can manage certain aspects of your Android app with the AndroidManifest.xml file.

There, you can configure three important things:

- The App name as it appears on the home screen: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5443304/how-to-change-an-android-apps-name

- The bundle identifier & package name of the app (also requires tweaking in other files): https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id

- The permissions of the app: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro#perms

You should also set an app version and change it with every app update. This is done in the build.gradle file, see: https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
